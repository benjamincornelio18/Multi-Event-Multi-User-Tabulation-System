# Multi-Event-Multi-User-Tabulation-System

This is a research based system for customized tabulatin. The proponent of this research is Benjamin L. Cornelio Jr. Here is the abstract. This study was designed and developed for the cultural office of the Iloilo State University Science and Technology Dingle Campus. Its purpose is to provide a tabulation system that can generate accurate and faster results in different contests with email certifying the judge's presence and participation. The researchers chose to have a developmental method of research for possible expansion of this system based on the needs of the Cultural Office of ISUFST Dingle Campus. The MEMU Tabulation system was subjected to quality evaluation using the Systems and software engineering â€“ Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) or known as ISO 25010.  In the evaluation process, the researchers considered the responses of 10 identified IT experts and 40 target end users purposely selected from pageant enthusiasts, contest coordinators, faculty, and student participants. The results of the evaluation clearly show that the system is a highly usable quality system with a rating of 4.65.
